# Mystery Word

## 🕹️ Description
This is a classic Mystery Word (Hangman) game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Players choose a category (Names, Animals, or Countries). The game then randomly selects a word from that category. Players guess letters one by one. Each correct guess reveals the letter's position in the word, while incorrect guesses draw a part of the hangman. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn!

## 🚀 Getting Started

2.  **Guess Letters:** Click on the letter buttons to guess.
3.  **Watch the Hangman:** If your guess is correct, the letter will appear in the word. If incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
4.  **Win or Lose:** Guess the word before the hangman is complete to win! If the hangman is fully drawn, you lose.
